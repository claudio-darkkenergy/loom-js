Significant updates to core routing including refactoring exports into a class-based singleton & adding `createRoutes` which sets up app routing for pages using lazy loading, supporting code splitting.

Pink Storybook stories completed for existing & newly added pink components while fixing a bunch of type errors and successful deployed builds.

Added a new block component, footer, to tags' blocks.
